# car-dealership
This code models a car dealership where cars are purchased and sold. Data structure used is a Hash Table for storing and searching.

This code reads in information about cars and stores their information in a Hash Table.

Each car has the following attributes:

VIN number

Year

Vehicle type

Manufacturer

Month Acquired/Sold

The car's VIN number serves as the key to the Hash Table. Once the Hash Table is full, it will automatically call the resize function of the Hash Table class.
